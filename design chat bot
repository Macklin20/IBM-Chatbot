 Designing a Chatbot Using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking
Problem Definition
The project involves creating a chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant with the primary goal of developing a virtual guide that assists users on messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Slack. The chatbot should provide valuable information, answer frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offer a friendly and engaging conversational experience. The project encompasses several key aspects:
1. Persona Design: Define the chatbot's persona, including its name, tone, and style of communication.
2. User Scenarios: Identify common user scenarios and frequently asked questions that the chatbot should be able to address effectively.
3. Conversation Flow: Design the conversation flow, outlining how the chatbot responds to various user queries and prompts.
4. Response Configuration: Configure the chatbot's responses using Watson Assistant's intents, entities, and dialog nodes to ensure accurate and context-aware interactions.
5. Platform Integration: Integrate the chatbot seamlessly with popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack.
6. User Experience: Ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, with clear prompts and informative responses that enhance user satisfaction.
        
  Design Thinking: Persona Design
Chatbot Name: "InfoBot"
Tone: Friendly, informative, and approachable.
Style of Communication: Conversational, with a touch of humor where appropriate to make interactions more engaging and enjoyable.
 
 User Scenarios
● UserScenario1:UserSeekingGeneralInformation - User: "Tell me about your services."
